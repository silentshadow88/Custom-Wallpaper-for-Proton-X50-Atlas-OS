## Proton X50 IHU-Atlas OS Custom Wallpaper Guide

This simple guide allows you to customize the background wallpaper on your Proton X50 IHU-Atlas OS to your own wallpaper.

## Please make sure to use the Xeon script first before proceeding with this guide.

### Installing Wallpaper

1. **Download the installation script.** [Download link here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aSx02853attAaX7MMRAXsLPV9SLAEyuL/view).
2. **Copy up to 3 images of your own choice in .png format to the root of your USB drive.** If you have image files in other formats, you can convert them using an online image converter or open with Paint and save them in .png format.
3. **Rename the .png image files to wallpaper_color, wallpaper_green, and wallpaper_default.** These names indicate the names of the 3 default wallpapers in the Theme app.
4. **Extract the downloaded zip file that contain installation script along with the 3 image files to the root of your USB drive.**
5. **Insert the USB drive into your IHU and wait for the script to execute, install the file manager, and reboot the IHU.** After following these steps, you will have the ES File Manager. Please be careful when using this file manager, as you can browse to other file systems.
6. **Open the ES File Manager and go to Home > Android > data > com.malaysia.theme > files > theme.** Copy all three original wallpapers, named **wallpaper_color.png, wallpaper_green.png, and wallpaper_default.png,** to a USB drive and save it safely. We will need it for later restoration.
7. **Delete all three original wallpapers from the theme folder and copy your own wallpaper from the USB drive to this folder.**
8. **Close the ES File Manager.**
9. **Try to go to the Theme app on your IHU, navigate to Wallpaper, choose Default, and select any of the three default wallpapers.** If you can see your own image apply to your background drawer, you have successfully installed a new wallpaper.
10. **If you want to change to another wallpaper, simply follow steps 2,3 and 7-9 again.**

### Restoring Wallpaper

1. **Copy the original wallpaper file that you have already backed up.**
2. **Insert the USB drive into the IHU and follow steps 6-9 above with the original wallpaper that you have backed up.**
3. **Try to go to the Theme app on your IHU, navigate to Wallpaper, choose Default, and select any of the three default wallpapers.** If you can see the original image apply to your background drawer, you have successfully restored the original wallpaper.
